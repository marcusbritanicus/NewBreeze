NewBreeze v3.0.0 RC3

✗ Option previews in Settings Manager and Startup Wizard
✓ Info Panel width should be adjustable => InfoPanel is now implemented as QDockWidget
◐ MediaInfo to show MediaInfo in InfoPanel and InfoBar
✓ Settings Manager to have two buttons: Apply and Close
	=> Apply saves all changes.
	=> Close closes the dialog, warning the user if there are any changes
✓ Extend support "Open folder with vlc" for other app like Audacious, Clementine etc.
✗ Create shortcut of folder and files - SymLinks?
	=> I still have no idea, why we require symlinks, or how the ui is supposed to be.
✓ Remember icon size of each view mode separately.
✗ There should be a limit to the items shown in FolderFlash.
	=> Takes almost the same amount of calculation to count the number of nodes.
	=> FolderFlash now uses the default QListView/QFileSystemModel to show folder contents
✗ Stop showing number of items/size below folders/files => This does not affect the performance.
✓ After copy, delete, empty trash, archive IO give a completion notification.
✓ Show the available list of plugins, and an option to enable and disable them.
✓ Auto mounting of devices through DBus/UDisks2 interface.
