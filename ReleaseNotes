NewBreeze v3.0.0
================

This is a completely native style GUI application. NewBreeze Native UI has been deprecated and removed. The main application itself is now natively styled. These are the
few changes in NewBreeze 3.

=> Qt5 Support
   - Qt5 is now the preferred version. Changes may or may not be backwards compatible.
   - This release onwards Qt5 builds are supported. Use qmake to build using Qt5.

=> User interface rebuilt, integrating code from NewBreeze and NewBreezeUI
   - File/Folder filtering

=> NBIconManager
    - NBIconManager now replaces old NBIconProvider
    - NBIconManager supports different icons for different sizes.
    - Very fast loading of icons

=> NBFileSystemWatcher( QFileSystemWatcher )
    - NBFileSystemWatcher was earlier rewritten with a cleaner code based on the inotify-example.c from http://www.lanedo.com/users/amorgado/fanotify/inotify-example.c
    - The above code was buggy and hence has been replaced with enhanced subclass of QFileSystemWatcher.

=> NBItemViewModel( QAbsractItemModel )
   - Formerly NBFileSystemModel, now it models Applications, Catalogs, and the FileSystem
   - Code cleanup for better performance.
   - NBItemViewModel provides upto 50% faster thumbnails loading for images.

=> NBIconView( QAbstractItemModel )
   - Per-folder views are now enabled. Each folder remembers its previous state ( size, grouping, list view, etc )
   - Mac-style partial folding of categories is now enabled.
   - Fixed the small issue of mouse/cursor selection conflict.
   - Fixed the SegFault with cursor up and down movements.
   # Currently has issues with cursorMovements. Will be fixed by v3-rc
   # List View and Tiles view are currently disabled. Will be fixed by v3-beta3

=> UI
   - An elementary Accidental Delete Protection (ADP) has been added. However it is not mature enough for commercial use.
   - ADP is rather buggy. It may not be advisable to enable it for all nodes.

=> NBAddressBar redesigned
   - NBBreadCrumbsBar is now called NBCrumbsBar.
   - It redesigned to make sure long paths do not run out of the widget.
   - The full path can be displayed using FlowLayout at anytime by pressing ▣

=> NBSidePanel and NBSideBar
   - NBSidePanel: Redesigned sidepanel with elegant menu listing the devices and bookmarks.
   - NBSideBar: A mac-like side panel
   - Devices ( or their tool tips ) show the space usage.
   - User can switch between classic and modern side panels from the

=> NBButton
   - NBButton has been rewritten to be a subclass of QPushButton, with better styling.
   - Issues with NBSegmentControl has caused me to go back to NBButtons, which have better appearance.

=> NBPreviewInterface
   - NBPreviewInterface is deprecated and deleted.

=> NBPluginInterface
   - All plugins are updated to use the standard NBPluginInteface.
   - NBPluginInterface can be used easily to extend Preview support for NewBreeze.
   - Defaults Plugins will now be shipped with NewBreeze rather than as a separate repo.

=> NBArchive extended
   - NBArchive is now rebuilt using libarchive for archive processing
   - GZip, BZip2, and XZ files are processed independently
   - Archive creation now shows a pretty dialog with some options
   - Archive creation and extraction is done via QtConcurrent::run(...) [Needs improvements]
   - Archive previews are now available, though it needs some improvements

=> SuperStart: A Super start to your day
   - All Drives are shown as you start NewBreeze.
   - Find all the important files and folders as soon as you start NewBreeze.
   - Press Ctrl+U to add selected file(s)/folder(s) to SuperStart.
   - In SuperStart, press Delete to remove them, F2 change the display name.
   - Note that changing display name does not rename the actual file on the hard drive.
   - A context menu will be added later.

=> NewBreeze Vault: Requires 'encfs'
   NOTE: This is work in progress. The first basic implementation is completed.
   - You can now access all your encrypted files and folders with out having to remember every password.
   - Currently, all the encrypted files and folders are being stored in and retrieved from an encrypted database.
   - Each added file or folder will be encrypted using a randomly generated unique 8196 bit (1 kiB) key.
   - NBCrypt Plugin is deprecated and a dummy will be installed in its place. (Will be removed in V3 stable release.)
   - Create a new ecrypted directory by pressing Ctrl+Shift+U.
   - Existing files/directories can be encrypted by choosing Actions > Encrypt in the context menu.
