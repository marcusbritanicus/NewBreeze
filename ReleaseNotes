NewBreeze v3.0.0
================

This is a completely native style GUI application. NewBreeze Native UI has been deprecated and removed. The main application itself is now natively styled. These are the
few changes in NewBreeze 3.

   - File/Folder filtering

=> NBIconManager
    - NBIconManager now replaces old NBIconProvider
    - NBIconManager supports different icons for different sizes.
    - Very fast loading of icons

=> NBFileSystemWatcher( QFileSystemWatcher )
    - NBFileSystemWatcher was earlier rewritten with a cleaner code based on the inotify-example.c from http://www.lanedo.com/users/amorgado/fanotify/inotify-example.c
    - The above code was buggy and hence has been replaced with enhanced subclass of QFileSystemWatcher.

=> NBItemViewModel( QAbsractItemModel )
   - Formerly NBFileSystemModel, now it models Applications, Catalogs, and the FileSystem
   - Code cleanup for better performance.
   - NBItemViewModel provides upto 50% faster thumbnails loading for images.

=> NBIconView( QAbstractItemView )
   - Per-folder views are now enabled. Each folder remembers its previous state ( size, grouping, list view, etc )

   NOTE: This is work in progress. The first basic implementation is completed.
   - You can now access all your encrypted files and folders with out having to remember every password.
